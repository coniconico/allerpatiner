États des patinoires à Montréal.
Skating rink conditions in Montréal.

Use a public xml data file from the city of Montréal.

This is my first project in Javascript ever ! 

The mentality was "find an idea and then learn the knowledge to build it" rather than "learn how to build and then find an idea to use the knowledge", so it was fun and motivational but hard without guidance because I had to learn and use AJAX Javascript on the fly. 
I ended up with something that work (not perfectly) and need a start over with cleaner solutions, but I realised that I really enjoyed Javascript (even through the struggle) and now I'm sure that I want to master it more in order to continue my journey towards advanced Javascript, frameworks (Vue.js <3) and creative coding (Three.js <3).
