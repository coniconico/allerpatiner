États des patinoires à Montréal.

Use a public xml data file from the city of Montréal.

This is my first project in Javascript ever ! 
The mentality was "find an idea and then learn the knowledge to build it" rather than "learn how to build and then find an idea to use the knowledge", so it was fun and motivational but a bit difficult without guidance because I had to learn and use advanced AJAX Javascript on the fly. 
I ended up with something that work not perfectly and need a start over from zero with cleaner solutions, but I realised that I really enjoyed Javascript and now I'm sure that I want to master it more in order to continue my journey trough advanced Javascript and frameworks (Vue.js <3).
